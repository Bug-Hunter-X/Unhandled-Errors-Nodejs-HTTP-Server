# Unhandled Errors in Node.js HTTP Server

This repository demonstrates a common error in Node.js: lack of error handling in an HTTP server.  The `bug.js` file shows a server that is susceptible to crashes if errors occur during request processing. The `bugSolution.js` demonstrates how to improve the error handling to prevent unexpected behavior.
